# Compiler_Project 
**SIP [Java C++ x_86]**</br>
This contains our current work which we have built a java compiler from scratch across 4 milestones.</br>
## Milestone 1:
* This folder contains the grammar of Java language with 0 conflicts. 
* We have added all the basic functionalities of Java along with some advanced like type casting and multidimenstional arrays. 
* We have also made a parse tree generator for the same</br>
## Milestone 2:
* This folder contains the symbol table data structure which we incorporated to store variables gloabbaly and loacally.
* We have also implemented typechecking for expressions, functions, arrays and classes.
* We have finally implemented the 3ac code which will help in milestone 3.
## Milestone 3:
* This folder contains the 3ac code implemented along with stack pointer manipulation.
* 3ac code which can be easily converted to x86 code is the ouptut of this milestone.
## Milestone 4:
* This folder contains the x86 code corresponding to the input Java program containing only integral types.
* We have added support for expressions, arrays, fucntion calls, objects and many other basic fucntionalities.
* The x86 code generated can be compiled using gcc and the output can be obtained.

## Marks Obtained:
* Milestone 1: 96%
* Milestone 1: 100%
* Milestone 1: 98%
* Milestone 1: 100%
